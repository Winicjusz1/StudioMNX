A single-page responsive website project showing how versatile Bootstrap is. The layout of this website is typical for a small or medium-sized company. While building this page, Bootstrap classes are used in conjunction with custom classes. The navigation has a class .scroll-fix with the use of the :: before pseudo-element which causes the section text not to be obscured by navigation on small screens. Conversely, the "body" tag has a "spy-scroll" attached to track navigation in order to show where the user is currently browsing the website. To such a page you can easily connect javascript in order to give it various functionalities.
